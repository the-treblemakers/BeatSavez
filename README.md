React app tool used to interface with the YouTube API, and the BeatWavez app song database. 

Builds and executes a batch of fetches, and then allows you to save the resulting array of song objects to a local file, or post them to the BeatWavez songs database.

Tool can be used to upload a single song object, or to send an array of song objects through a batch upload endpoint. Tool also allows pulling all songs from the database to copy or save to a backup file locally.
